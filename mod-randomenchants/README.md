# RandomEnchantsModule
* <b>!!BEFORE RUNNING!!:</b> Execute the included "conf/SQL/item_enchantment_random_tiers.sql" file on your world database. This creates a necessary table for this module.
* This is a "fun" script/module converted from an LUA script I found, credits to whoever did this originally
* <b> What this does:</b>
* Will sometimes add random enchantments on any item Looted, Quest Rewarded or Profession created
* <b> Configurable:</b>
* Login message for the module (on, off and what to display)
* Select if you want to enchant loot, quest reward, profession or all
* <b>Modify the source to mess with the chances of enchantment</b>
