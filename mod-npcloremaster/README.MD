# Loremaster NPC

## Description

This places a Loremaster NPC in the game world at various locations who recants the lore of the old world and
brings back the lost memories of so many that sacrificed their lives for this ravaged land we all call home.

As of the release of this module, I have only had time to create three of these NPCs, but I have plans for many
more in the future and hope that the community will contribute. I have written the module so adding new Loremaster
NPCs is done purely in the database and will chain to one another automatically if done correctly.
