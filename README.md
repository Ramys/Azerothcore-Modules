# AC-Modules
WowTorn 
this is my compilation of working modules, the reason these are not on AzerothCore git is because for any broken confs or announcements have been disabled in the cpp files of those broken mods, AH-Bot needs to be set in the cpp and gambler npc . please feel free to fix properly and PR to AzerothCore my workload is massive. :) enjoy 

Announcer and .conf fixed:
CodeBox  working
BuffMaster  working
VAS_Autobalance working
